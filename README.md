## **Introduction**
1. This project involves analyzing a survey respomse dataset to derive meaningful insights and trends.  
2. The analysis uses Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization.  
3. The goal is to help stakeholders understand sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.

## **Objective**
The objectives of this project include finding insight of the following:
1. Demographic Insights 
2. Consumer Preferences 
3. Competition Analysis 
4. Marketing Channels and Brand Awareness 
5. Brand Penetration
6. Purchase Behavior 
7. Product Development

## **Technologies Used**
The project leverages the following tools and libraries:
- **Python:** Programming language for data analysis.
- **Pandas:** For data cleaning, manipulation, and exploration.
- **NumPy:** For numerical calculations.
- **Matplotlib:** For data visualization.
- **seaborn:** For data visualization.

## **Dataset Details**
- **Description:** [Link to meta_data.txt file](https://github.com/Nazneenp/codeX-energy-drink/blob/main/meta_data.txt)
- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handled missing values in the `dim_repondents` table.

## **Key Analysis Performed**
